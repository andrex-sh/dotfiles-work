# workspaces 1-9 go to primary; workspace 10 is dedicated to secondary.
# Outputs may be given as a connector name (DP-3) or as a "make model serial"
# identifier, which contains spaces - hence the inner quotes below, so sway
# sees one output argument rather than several.
# Whichever profile calls this should also `exec pkill waybar; exec waybar` -
# kanshi's start races sway's own `exec waybar`, so without this waybar keeps
# the pre-kanshi output layout until restarted.
